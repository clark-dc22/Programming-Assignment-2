ECE 2112: Advanced Computer Programming and Algorithms - Experiment 2
Experiment Title: Numerical Python (NumPy)
Description
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook implementation for Experiment 2 of the ECE 2112 course. The experiment focuses on using the NumPy Library for numerical computations in Python, specifically addressing two problems: array normalization and filtering elements divisible by 3.

**Learning Outcomes**

This experiment demonstrates:

- Working with NumPy arrays and their properties

- Implementing mathematical operations on arrays

- Using array filtering and boolean indexing

- Saving and loading NumPy arrays

**Files Included:**

- DEL CARMEN_PA#2.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook containing the complete solution

- divisibles_by_3.npy - Output file for the divisible by 3 problem

**Problems Solved:**
